\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Analog}
Although the simulations presented in \cref{Analog_res} seems quite promising. 
Seeing as the capacitor gets charged at the different voltages under the different simulated lighting conditions. 
As well as being discharged when the erase transistor gets activated. 
The circuit has yet to be tested simulated in a mixed signal simulation. 
The SPICE simulations have "hard" coded control signals to simulate the digital control, meaning that the interface between the two parts has yet to be tested.

\subsubsection{Corner analysis}
The process variations are not simulated on the complete analog circuit, only on a single NMOS switch. 
Therefore there is no reason to rule out that process variations may affect the function and performance of the analog circuit.

\subsection{Digital}
The digital circuit seems to function after the specification, this means that it works under the same timing as the analog circuit does. 
However since the verilog HDL is only synthesized and simulated in software and has yet to be implemented in hardware, there is no guarantee that a hardware implementation will work as simulated.
