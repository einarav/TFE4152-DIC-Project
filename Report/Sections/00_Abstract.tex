\section*{Abstract}
This is considered the end result of the semester project in the course TFE4152 Design of Integrated Circuits, at NTNU.\\
This report includes the applied theory and the design process of a CMOS implementation of the digital control circuit as well as the analog readout circuit for a four pixel digital camera.\\
The report is intended for readers with knowledge within electrical engineering and/or CMOS technology, but the basic concepts could be understood by anyone.\\
The simulation verifies the intended functionality of both the analog and digital part of the camera, but has yet to simulated together in a mixed signal simulation as well as being implemented and tested in actual hardware. 

All source code and the source of this document can also be found in out GitHib reposiory.
