\section{Conclusion}
Since all simulation results function after specification, the digital camera module is at least theoretically accomplished. 
Both the analog and digital parts of the system works individually, but has yet to be simulated together in a mixed signal analysis. 
A simulation tool supporting both analog and digital mixed signal analysis should be used to test this functionality.

Seeing as the module has only been simulated, it is still only theoretically accomplished and has yet to be implemented in hardware. 
The process variations of the analog circuit may affect a hardware implementation. 
A hardware implementation of the digital circuit may also not work as the simulations shows.
