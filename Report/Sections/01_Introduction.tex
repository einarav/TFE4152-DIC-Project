\section{Introduction}
To capture digital representations of images digital cameras are used. 
As these cameras are becoming more advanced while reproducing better images, they are still required to shrink in physical size.\\
CMOS technology can be a solution to the challenges faced when shrinking physical size while increasing the performance. \\

This project report completes a theoretical CMOS implementation of a digital camera, with both an analog readout circuit and a digital control module.
The analog circuit is simulated and verified using SPICE simulations, while the digital is implemented using the HDL SystemVerilog.
